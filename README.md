# Craverly Heights (PunyInform)

Recently one game, Craverly Heights by Ryan Veeder, has been ported to
several IF languages. The original was written in Inform 7, and 
Linus Åkesson ported it to dialog. Henrik Åsman then ported it to ZIL,
and now I have ported it to PunyInform.

I have tried to stay true to the original disposition of the source code to make it possible to compare the original Inform 7 vs Dialog vs ZIL vs PunyInform.

The file obviously contains lot of spoilers so be sure to try the original game if you not already done that. There are seven different endings, try finding them all!

The original can be played online here: https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=lwydetlk1o0vc91q

The Inform 7 and Dialog source code are here: https://linusakesson.net/dialog/craverly/craverly_side_by_side.html
