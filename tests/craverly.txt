Roland Memorial Hospital
The whirring and chirping of medical instruments is all around - a
worrying commotion, to some, but to your ears it is as regular as a
heartbeat, as usual as business. While you walk these sterile halls,
you are in your element: the element of health. The exit is east.

Pauline, pale and frail, looks up at you pleadingly from her supine
position aboard her hospital bed.

> X PAULINE

You gaze down meaningfully at Pauline, at her once-soft features cast
into sharp relief by the mysterious illness that wracks her youthful
form.

"Oh, Doctor Langridge," Pauline rasps, "Tell me some good news."

"I wish I could," you say, "but the truth is that your condition is
getting worse. And the even worse news is that your insurance won't
pay for your procedure."

Pauline's lip quivers.

> X ME

You are Doctor Langridge, mentor to some, friend to many, and healer
to all of the citizens of Craverly Heights. Everyone in town knows
your name. It is Doctor Langridge.

You are empty handed.

> X MACHINES

Sorry, I don't understand what "instruments" means.

> HUG PAULINE

You lean down until your face almost meets Pauline's. "The Hippocratic
Oath warns a doctor not to give into his or her feelings for a
patient," you say, "but an oath can only be kept for so long." Pauline
rises weakly to kiss you passionately. The moment is perfect, but it
does not last forever.

"No one can know about this," you say. Pauline nods weakly.



> TALK TO PAULINE

"Can't anything be done, Doctor Langridge?" Pauline asks pitifully.

"I'll talk to your mother," you say, though your countenance does not
indicate confidence.

A gargantuan portrait of the hawk-eyed and hawk-nosed Leopold Craverly
stares down at you from its perch on the mahogany-panelled wall. The
exit is north.

Standing beneath the portrait is Leopold Craverly himself, identical
to his own image in every way. He eyes you sternly from his perch atop
his snake-headed cane.



> TALK TO LEOPOLD

"What's new over at Roland Memorial, Langridge?" Leopold asks.

"It's Gina's daughter, Pauline. They can't afford the only procedure
that will keep her alive. But, Mister Craverly, I know you are not an
uncharitable man."

Leopold lets loose a torrent of guffaws. "I think that sentence needs
one more negative, Langridge! Of what concern to me is the situation
of a girl I wouldn't recognize on the street?"

Your response to this question is a glare like a polished silver
dagger.

"I beg you to reconsider Janine's plight, Mister Craverly," you say.

"I think you mean Pauline. And I beg you to leave off the

Though his hair is silver-white, and his eyes have been furrowed by a
lifetime of avarice and cynicism, Leopold still has many years left in
his life, and many goals left to achieve in those years, no matter
what or who stands in his way.

"I beg you to reconsider Janine's plight, Mister Craverly," you say.

"I think you mean Pauline. And I beg you to leave off the

"What's that there?" Craverly asks.

"It's Wendell," you say. "Pauline's dog."

"Ah, I see, I see. And how has he been doing?"

"He died three years ago," you answer meaningfully, "Under mysterious
circumstances."

Craverly stares meaningfully back at you.

"Pauline's insurance has run out," you say. Gina's expression descends
into concern.

"She needs a procedure, or she'll die," you continue. "Is there any
way you can pay for it?"

"This pizzeria is barely paying for its own bills," says Gina. "All
the money I could have spent to save Pauline's life, I spent on my
dream of becoming a restauranteur."

"We all have to live with our mistakes," you say, "but Pauline may not
have long to live with yours."

Gina tries to hide her face.

the jewels."

"Yeah, well, right after I got out of prison I went back to that
place, where we buried the jewels. But someone got there first.
Someone dug them up."

Pauline gasps. "But who else knew about the jewels?"

"Only one person," you menacingly say.

"The jewels!" Pauline gasps, her breathlessness as much a factor of
her surprise as a consequence of her illness. "Then you were able to
convince..."

"Mister Craverly, yes. The jewels are mine - ours, now."

"Sidney, we can sell the jewels for the money for the medical
treatment that will save my life!" Pauline's eyes are huge and wet
beneath the hospital lights as they plaintively gaze upward into your
own.

"Sugarbabe, those were my thoughts exactly."

???

"Why is Sidney nice all of a sudden?"

"Well, I thought about just abandoning Janine, but I realized I had a
chance to push things in a bold new direction."

"It's Pauline. And that's not gonna work. People love Sidney the evil
twin; they're not going to respond well to Sidney the altruist.
Besides, Pauline has to stay sick until Lisa has her baby."

"Oh. Do we need to shoot the whole thing again?"

"There's no time. We'll figure something out."

meaningfully. "They constitute conclusive proof that you are Pauline's

The weight of this revelation nearly knocks Leopold onto the floor. He
grasps his cane all the tighter, and mutters:

"Nineteen years ago... The train tunnel collapse!"

"The underground gases that seeped into the tunnel caused amnesia in
all of the passengers," you explain. "Nobody on the train could
remember what happened before the rescue team arrived. But now we know
about one thing that definitely did happen. You and Gina conceived a
child, a child that desperately needs a medical procedure she can't
afford."

"I'll pay every cent!" Leopold is on the verge of tears. "I have a
daughter! The Craverly line will go on!"

"So Pauline's gonna be okay?"

"Of course! We were never gonna kill her off. She has to stay in that

The director leans back and sighs. "Now, you guys did a good job out

accomplishment. But before we get working on #6002, we gotta get one
thing done."

Standing beneath the portrait is Leopold Craverly himself, identical
to his own image in every way. He eyes you sternly from his perch atop
his snake-headed cane.



> KISS LEO

Leopold pushes you away. "Forget it, Sid. I'm not one of those young
people who melts in half when a criminal comes on to him."

West Hallway
Craverly Manor is south from here. The hallway continues east.



> E


Hallway Intersection
Nobody's around.

The hallway runs north, south, east, and west from here.

A non-diegetic bulletin is posted on the wall.



> N


North Hallway
Pauline's hospital room is west from here. The hallway continues
south.

There's a rack of shelves standing against this end of the hall.



> W


Roland Memorial Hospital
The whirring and chirping of medical instruments is all around - a
worrying commotion. The exit is east.

Pauline, pale and frail, looks up at you confusedly from her supine
position aboard her hospital bed.



> WEAR MAGNIFYING

That doesn't seem to be something you can wear.



> KISS PAULINE

You plant a long, meaningful kiss on Pauline's quivering lips. "It's
been so long," she sighs.



> SHOOT ME

With the pistol aimed at your temple, you almost pull the deadly
trigger that could free the world from the scourge of the existence of
the dastardly Sidney Langridge, but you pull the gun away from your
head, suddenly.

"Sorry to disappoint," you announce, "But Sid Langridge is gonna be
around for a while longer. I've got things to do."

You sneer menacingly.



> E


North Hallway
Janine's hospital room is west from here. The hallway continues south.

There's a rack of shelves standing against this end of the hall.



> REMOVE GLASSES

You take off the sunglasses.



> W


Roland Memorial Hospital
The whirring and chirping of medical instruments is all around - a
worrying commotion, to some, but to your ears it is as regular as a
heartbeat, as usual as business. While you walk these sterile halls,
you are in your element: the element of health. The exit is east.

Pauline, pale and frail, looks up at you pleadingly from her supine
position aboard her hospital bed.



> SHOOT ME

"I've had it," you announce. "I can't go on. All the secrets. All the
lies. I'm finished. This is the end for your beloved Doctor Langridge.
And little do you know: the secret of Wendell's death dies with me!"

"Why. Why did you do that."

"It's like I said! I can't go on. I quit. Craverly Heights is a
sinking ship, and this rat is jumping off."

"First of all, that remark is offensive to rats. Second, you can't
quit. Your contract has you in this studio for the next three years."

"Well, what are you going to do? Doctor Langridge is dead."

"Oh, that's not a problem..."
